# Docker-Srcds
A container that installs and runs an srcds server for the specified game.

### What's different about this than the others?
It not only installs the server you want, but it also launches it on container start. All files are created at runtime, meaning you can mount the container to the host filesystem and easily manage the server there. See examples below.
